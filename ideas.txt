IDEAS

powerfull cards have cooldowns -> on cd pile
after cd it comes in your used cards pile
if your pile of available cards is empty, it will be reshuffled


items have cards,
item cards can have a 1 time use.


Each round you get 4 cards, from which you can use 2. All cards go to your used cards pile

switching weapons, costs a chosen card. weapon cards will be removed, new weapon cards will be put into discarded pile

-------------------

1 round you get 3-4 cards, 1 free (move 2) card and 1 free attack 2 card. So you always have a move and an attack.

If you pass and did not use any of free cards, you have to discard one.

Pass twice in a row, means round end for player.

player starts, then monster. or highest initiative starts.

--

Cards  come from your items, boots / pants give move cards

Boots can also give attack (kick)

armor helm give defence cards

shield gives defence and attack cards

sword give attack cards
